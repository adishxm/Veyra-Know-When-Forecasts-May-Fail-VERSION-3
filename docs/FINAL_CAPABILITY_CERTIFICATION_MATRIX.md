## 1. Authoritative Capability Certification Matrix

| Capability | Implemented | Tested | Empirical | Calibrated | OOD | Independent Eval | Operational | Certified | Limitations / Evidence |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **V3 bust probability** | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | **YES** | LightGBM v3.0 + Isotonic regression on 15,000 held-out OOT rows. Certified strictly for 25 benchmark Indian surface stations and lead times 24h–240h. |
| **Precipitation specialist** | YES | YES | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES | **NO** | Formula heuristic baseline (CAPE/RH threshold rules). No empirical trained ML weights. Operates as diagnostic comparator only; not certified as predictive ML. |
| **Cyclone / rare-hazard specialists** | YES | YES | NO | NO | NO | NO | YES | **NO** | Physics heuristic baseline (vorticity/pressure gradient). Fails empirical ML criteria; certified operational as prototype rule-based early warning only. |
| **Failure memory / analog retrieval** | YES | YES | YES | N/A | YES | YES | YES | **YES** | Exact cosine/Mahalanobis retrieval over verified historical failure signatures in `backend/app/services/analog_service.py`. Verified on historical IMD bust cases. |
| **Trust Horizon / time-to-bust** | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | **YES** | Evaluated across discrete lead buckets (24h to 240h). Strict rejection of >240h lead horizons in code and frontend dropdowns. |
| **Revision intelligence** | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | **YES** | Multi-cycle consecutive forecast trajectory tracking via durable SQLite revision store. Prevents silent zeroing of revision features; causal guarantees verified. |
| **Spatial reliability / propagation** | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | **YES** | Spatial error pools across 5 agro-climatic zones with Haversine distance weighting. Fails closed with `UNVERIFIED` for non-benchmark locations (>0.2° away). |
| **Multi-NWP semantics** | YES | YES | NO | NO | YES | NO | YES | **NO** | Live Open-Meteo primary + mock GEFS secondary adapter. Disagreement contract verified, but lacks 31 live operational ensemble feeds. Not certified as ensemble spread. |
| **Vertical atmosphere / regimes** | YES | YES | YES | NO | YES | YES | YES | **NO** | Diagnostic soundings, lapse rate calculation, and vertical wind shear from ERA5 levels. Operational as diagnostic features; no standalone regime certification. |
| **Conformal coverage** | YES | YES | NO | YES | YES | NO | YES | **NO** | Split conformal coverage engine implemented and tested on synthetic fixtures. Marginal 90% coverage achieved on fixtures; empirical regime-conformal validation pending. |
| **Foundation representation** | YES | YES | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | **NO** | Architected interface in place. Blocked from production due to requirement for multi-GPU external foundation checkpoints. Status: `BLOCKED / DATA-GATED`. |
| **Generative spatial field** | YES | YES | NO | NO | NO | NO | NO | **NO** | Research roadmap prototype for generative spatial fields. Quarantined in research branch. Status: `FUTURE`. |
| **Decision utility / VOI** | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | YES | **NO** | Asymmetric loss matrices and value-of-information calculations. Software operational under declared loss costs; not certified as scientific meteorology. |
| **TreeSHAP / explainability** | YES | YES | YES | N/A | YES | YES | YES | **YES** | Exact TreeSHAP feature attribution computed on active LightGBM booster. Top 5 positive and negative contributing atmospheric factors computed per prediction. |
| **Independent truth verification** | YES | YES | YES | N/A | YES | YES | YES | **YES** | Strict out-of-time evaluation against independent ERA5 / IMD ground truth observations with immutable SHA-256 provenance hashes. |
